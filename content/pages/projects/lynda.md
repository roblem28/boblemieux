Named in honor of someone who believed deeply in the potential of technology to support human connection and capability, this project explores conversational AI systems with persistent memory, contextual awareness, and long-term continuity. It's an experimental platform for testing how agents can maintain relationships over time, adapt to evolving needs, and function as true companions rather than disposable tools. The focus is human-centered design—building systems that feel thoughtful, reliable, and genuinely helpful rather than transactional.
