## Project Snapshot

The Milwaukee Regional Mobility Corridor packages light rail, BRT, and
streetscape upgrades into a single $1.1B capital program. As design-assist and
construction manager at risk contracts mobilized, the city needed an integrated
controls environment that combined schedule health with earned value insights for
monthly council briefings.

## Role and Approach

- **Role:** Ownerâ€™s project controls lead overseeing a blended city and
  consultant team.
- Normalized six prime contractor schedule files and synchronized them with the
  program-level Primavera P6 schedule, aligning coding structures and resource
  calendars.
- Established an earned value baseline tied to 27 control accounts, mapping
  funding sources and contract milestones to support grant reporting.
- Designed a Power BI portal with drill-down charts that compared SPI, CPI, and
  milestone status for each corridor segment, feeding automated PDF decks for
  stakeholders.

## EVM Analysis Highlights

Created rolling 12-week trend charts highlighting variances and forecast finish
positions, reinforcing risk narratives with look-ahead Gantt visuals. Variance
reason codes were captured through weekly contractor workshops and displayed in
an interactive matrix that prioritized corrective actions.

## Outcomes

- Maintained SPI between 0.98 and 1.04 despite utility relocation volatility,
  protecting the critical path to revenue service in Q4 2025.
- Reduced reporting cycle time from eight days to less than 36 hours, enabling
  city leadership to brief federal partners with current data.
- Delivered a capital dashboard adopted by the finance office for ongoing bond
  oversight and contingency management.

## Deliverables

- Integrated master schedule with risk scoring, float erosion alerts, and
  interface milestone logic
- Earned value manual and templates aligned to FTA grant compliance
- Executive-ready dashboards, variance narratives, and corrective action logs
