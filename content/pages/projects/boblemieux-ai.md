This site is more than a portfolio—it's a self-hosted AI lab running local language models, fine-tuned agents, and document processing pipelines. I use it to test autonomous workflows, build custom tools for construction data analysis, and experiment with multi-agent systems that can draft reports, summarize documents, and generate structured outputs from unstructured inputs. It's a testbed for next-generation project intelligence systems that don't just assist with tasks but execute them end-to-end with minimal human oversight. The infrastructure here directly informs the tools I deploy in real projects—it's where theory becomes execution.
