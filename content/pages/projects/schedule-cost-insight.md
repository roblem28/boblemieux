Traditional project reporting relies on people reading through dense schedule files and cost summaries to find what matters—a process that's slow, subjective, and often misses early warning signs. I built an AI-enabled pipeline that ingests P6 XML exports, cost reports, and turnover logs, then classifies activities, extracts critical path changes, summarizes variances, and flags emerging risks in plain language. The system turns raw project data into actionable intelligence in minutes instead of days, giving teams the ability to respond to cost overruns, schedule slippage, and resource conflicts before they compound.
