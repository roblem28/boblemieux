Most AI and compute tools assume you're sitting at a desk with power, internet, and a full workstation—but real-world work doesn't always happen there. Marley1 is a portable platform designed to bring serious AI capability into the field: a compact device running local LLMs, agent systems, and edge processing that can operate offline or on limited networks. It's built for environments where traditional laptops are impractical and cloud dependence is a liability—industrial sites, remote locations, or mobile use cases that demand intelligence without infrastructure. The goal isn't to replace desktops; it's to extend capability into contexts where it's never existed before.
