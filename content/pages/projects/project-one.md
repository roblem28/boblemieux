## Opportunity

The owner engaged me midway through a $420M Gulf Coast LNG train turnaround
when field execution had slipped 11% against the critical path. Work-fronts were
being released late, contractor updates were inconsistent, and leadership lacked
a single source of truth that combined earned value metrics with schedule risk.

## Role and Approach

- **Role:** Turnaround controls advisor embedded with the project director and
  owner-side project controls team.
- Conducted a forensic schedule assessment of 9,800 activities, validating logic
  ties and integrating contractor look-aheads with the Primavera P6 baseline.
- Rebuilt the earned value structure to align cost accounts with the master
  schedule, enabling accurate SPI/CPI calculations across 14 work packages.
- Developed Power BI dashboards fed by automated P6 and cost management exports
  so that daily field progress, variance reason codes, and recovery actions were
  visible to the steering committee.

## EVM Insights and Visualizations

Using refreshed resource curves, I generated weekly trend charts showing SPI and
CPI convergence, overlaying the recovery glidepath against the contractual
milestone line. Quantified schedule risk exposure with Monte Carlo scenarios and
mapped float consumption to area leads, focusing recovery crews on the highest
value work-fronts.

## Outcomes

- Restored mechanical completion float by 24 days and closed a $12.4M negative
  cost variance while maintaining safe execution.
- Provided executive-ready slide decks and live dashboards that the owner now
  uses as the template for all North American turnarounds.
- Institutionalized a control room cadence with daily KPI huddles that sustained
  SPI &gt; 1.03 through completion.

## Key Deliverables

- Primavera P6 recovery schedule with risk-adjusted scenario modeling
- Daily EVM dashboard highlighting SPI/CPI, constraint logs, and variance
  clearance actions
- Executive reporting pack aligning earned value signals with decision-ready
  recommendations
