Project controls teams spend days compiling schedule updates, cost forecasts, and variance reports from fragmented data sources—P6 exports, contractor submittals, budget trackers, and manual logs. I developed a suite of advanced Excel models with VBA automation that ingests this data, normalizes formats, calculates key metrics, and outputs executive dashboards with minimal human input. These tools have become the backbone of weekly reporting for multi-hundred-million-dollar projects, replacing error-prone manual processes with consistent, audit-ready outputs. The result: faster reporting cycles, fewer mistakes, and leadership that trusts the numbers.
