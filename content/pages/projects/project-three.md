## Context

Atlantic Wind Partners accelerated their foundation fabrication and offshore
installation campaign to capture investment tax credits and meet regulatory
milestones. Multiple European fabricators, Gulf Coast marshaling yards, and
marine spreads needed an aligned schedule and earned value framework to manage
logistics risk across three time zones.

## Role and Execution

- **Role:** Program controls manager accountable for schedule integration,
  earned value performance, and executive reporting.
- Merged fabrication, marshaling, and installation schedules into an integrated
  Primavera P6 model with resource leveling to protect float on crane barges and
  critical lifts.
- Implemented an earned value structure tied to 19 fabrication lots and 11
  offshore campaigns, capturing progress via digital QA signoffs and vessel AIS
  feeds.
- Produced Tableau dashboards showing SPI, CPI, and productivity curves alongside
  metocean risk triggers, enabling the JV board to authorize contingency tow-outs
  ahead of storm seasons.

## EVM Visualization and Insights

Trend charts highlighted variance recovery as fabrication yards introduced second
shifts. Forecast modules compared planned vs earned hours, while a claims-ready
narrative library linked EVM signals to change-event documentation for future
commercial discussions.

## Outcomes

- Restored 18 days of float on the installation schedule and achieved an SPI of
  1.07 by the close of the summer campaign.
- Provided defensible EVM-backed reporting that accelerated a $95M tax equity
  milestone draw.
- Delivered a reusable reporting playbook now deployed on the developerâ€™s second
  offshore wind project.

## Deliverables

- Integrated master schedule with marine weather windows and fabrication look-aheads
- Earned value dashboard suite with variance narratives and claims documentation
- Executive board reporting package and stakeholder visualization templates
