  A unified dashboard system that tracks completion status, punch progress, and
  handover readiness across hundreds of systems in real time. Built to eliminate
  spreadsheet chaos and surface delays before they impact commissioning.

Large capital projects generate thousands of completion items across mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, and controls disciplines—and tracking them in spreadsheets creates blind spots. I built a centralized dashboard that pulls punch list data, system completion status, and handover documentation into a single visual command center. The system updates in real time, flags incomplete paths, and gives superintendents and commissioning teams immediate clarity on what's blocking turnover. It's eliminated hundreds of hours of manual reconciliation and reduced handover delays by surfacing issues weeks earlier than traditional tracking allowed.
