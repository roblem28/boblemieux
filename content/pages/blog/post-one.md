If you’ve ever wondered what we stash in the walk-in cellar behind the copper tap wall, this month’s **Barrel Bash Tap Takeover** is your backstage pass. We spent the past year trading for barrels, tasting through collabs, and aging a few passion projects to build a six-beer lineup that leans into caramelized sugar, toasted oak, and nuanced fruit.

## The tap list at a glance

1. **Cascade Cellars — Cherry Noir 2022**
   Rich cherry compote, amaretto, and a pleasant tannic finish from Pinot barrels.
2. **What Ales You × Rose City Spirits — Rye Maple Porter**
   Our silky porter rested in rye whiskey barrels with maple staves for six months.
3. **Matchstick Brewing — Coniferous Night**
   Spruce tips and cacao nibs make this imperial stout equal parts forest walk and dessert.
4. **North Pier — Amburana Dreams**
   Brazilian amburana wood brings warm baking spice to a chewy barleywine base.
5. **Finn’s Cellar Project — Vanilla Orchid Stout**
   We double conditioned this imperial stout on Tahitian vanilla and toasted coconut.
6. **Wild Current Meadery — Cocoa Berry Cyser**
   Technically a mead, but the barrel-aged apple cider base plays beautifully with cocoa nibs.

## How to taste like a pro

- **Start light.** Work your way from the cherry-forward sour to the richer stouts so your palate stays sharp.
- **Share pours.** Every beer clocks in above 9% ABV; grab a friend (or two) and order half pours to sample everything.
- **Let it warm up.** Barrel-aged beers shine closer to cellar temp. Take your time and chat between sips.
- **Snack smart.** Chef Lynda created a snack board with smoked almonds, blue cheese, and chocolate sea-salt caramels that bridge the flavors in the lineup.

## Take home the goods

We’ve set aside a limited number of crowlers for each release. Ask your bartender to reserve one early in the evening, and don’t forget to join the barrel club list below so you’re first in line for future drops.

Cheers to sharing what we’ve been aging—see you at the takeover!
