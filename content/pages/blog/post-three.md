Every Wednesday we dim the lights, drop the needle, and let rare records guide our whiskey flights. Here’s what goes into curating the night.

## Digging through crates

- Maeve spends Monday morning at Musique Boutique scouting for near-mint pressings.
- We give first dibs to local musicians who want to debut new work between sets.
- Guest DJs submit mini mixes that inspire our pairing menu.

## Building the flight

1. **Intro pour** — A low-proof bourbon to ease into the evening.
2. **Feature flight** — Three single barrels chosen to match the night’s genre.
3. **Wildcard** — Something unexpected from our reserve shelf.
4. **Zero-proof treat** — A spirit-free cocktail that mirrors the flavor profile of the feature flight.

## Setting the vibe

- Candles on every table, plush lounge seating, and a no-shouting policy keep conversations intimate.
- Requests are welcome—drop yours below and we’ll shout you out when your track spins.
- Merch alert: we now have limited-edition Whiskey & Vinyl glassware available behind the bar.

See you next Wednesday for another spin around the sun.
