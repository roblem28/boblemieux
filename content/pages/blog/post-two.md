There’s a certain kind of magic that settles over the pub every Sunday afternoon. The lights dim a touch, the playlist slows down, and the kitchen crew leans into a rhythm that feels like cooking for family.

## Sourcing the ingredients

- **Farms & fields.** We partner with Cedar Glen Farm for root vegetables, Laughing Goat Dairy for chèvre, and Old Town Greens for winter herbs.
- **Baker buddies.** Hearth & Honey keeps us stocked with sourdough boules that soak up every drop of gravy.
- **Barrel pantry.** Finn shares his stash of barrel-aged syrups and bitters to glaze carrots or finish sauces.

## The menu staples

1. **Cast-iron mac & cheese** with three cheeses and breadcrumb crunch.
2. **Stout-braised short ribs** on garlic mashed potatoes with roasted mushrooms.
3. **Charred brassica salad** tossed with preserved lemon vinaigrette and spiced pepitas.
4. **Flaky buttermilk biscuits** served with smoked honey butter.
5. **Seasonal pie flight** rotating through apple crumble, chocolate chess, and pear frangipane.

## Rituals you’ll taste

- We finish every platter with fresh herbs clipped from our patio garden.
- Lynda plates each course herself so temperatures and textures stay spot-on.
- The bar pairs every supper with a suggested beer, cocktail, and zero-proof option.

We cap seating at forty guests to keep things intimate. If Sunday supper sounds like your vibe, grab a reservation below—we can’t wait to cook for you.
