    title: Our story is poured by hand
    subtitle: From a homebrew obsession to Old Town’s favorite gathering place.
    text: >-
      When siblings Maeve and Finn O’Malley opened The Pub for What Ales You in 2008, they set out to create the kind of taproom they wanted to hang out in—warm lighting, soul-comforting food, a bar program that mixes tradition with experimentation, and staff who remember your go-to order.

    subtitle: Why locals choose The Pub for What Ales You
    text: >-
      **Community first.** Every trivia host, songwriter, and brewer we feature hails from the Pacific Northwest. We partner with neighborhood makers for seasonal tap takeovers and donate a portion of every Sunday supper to Old Town Mutual Aid.

      **Craft without pretense.** We love a perfectly poured pilsner and we love a good pickleback. Our bar crew chases balance over trends, curating rotating tap lists, slow-crafted cocktails, and zero-proof drinks that feel just as special.

      **Comfort, always.** From our cast-iron mac & cheese to the cedar-smoked wings, our kitchen honors classic pub fare with Northwest ingredients. Grab a seat by the fireplace, at the copper-top bar, or on the dog-friendly patio—everyone is welcome here.
